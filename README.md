# Stuyvesant Computational Physics â€” Project Portfolio

**Live Gallery (interactive demos):**  
ðŸ‘‰ https://tasnemo.github.io/Stuy-Computational-Physics/

This repository collects my work from **Stuyvesant High Schoolâ€™s Computational Physics program**, implemented in **Web VPython (GlowScript)** and exported to standalone HTML. The projects are organized in folders by topic, mirroring the original Python source structure. Each demo runs **directly in your browser** â€” no installs required.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Groups

The `/docs` folder contains the published HTMLs, grouped into subfolders:

- **Chaos / RNG / Logistic**  
  Logistic map simulations, chaos sensitivity, and a custom pseudo-random number generator powering a roulette simulation.

- **Celestial Mechanics**  
  Interactive orbital mechanics and N-body sketches with energy and angular momentum conservation checks.

- **Eulerâ€“Cromer & Integration Methods**  
  Implementations of Eulerâ€“Cromer, Verlet, and comparison of numerical integrators (trapezoid, Simpson, etc.) for stability and accuracy.

- **Finite Difference / PDEs**  
  Heat/diffusion equation solvers with stability analysis and boundary conditions.

- **Multi-System & Final Projects**  
  More complex simulations combining multiple systems and physical effects, including cinematic visualizations.

Each folder under `/docs` has its own set of `.html` files; the [Live Gallery](https://tasnemo.github.io/Stuy-Computational-Physics/) automatically discovers and lists them.

## ðŸš€ Skills Demonstrated

- **Numerical Methods**: Eulerâ€“Cromer, Verlet, trapezoid & Simpsonâ€™s rule, finite difference discretizations.
- **Modeling & Simulation**: Translating physical laws into code, exploring stability/accuracy tradeoffs, and running parameter sweeps.
- **Chaos & Randomness**: Logistic map bifurcations, sensitivity to initial conditions, Monte Carlo intuition, RNG design.
- **Mechanics & Orbits**: Orbital dynamics, conservation laws, perturbations, and phase-space reasoning.
- **Scientific Communication**: Browser-based demos for clear, installation-free presentation.
